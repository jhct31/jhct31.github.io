        <h2>Accomodation and Catering</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">
            At Collingwood you will find:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard bedrooms: a study bedroom with sink. On floors of standard bedrooms, up to ten students share two separate toilets and two separate showers.</li>
            <li>En-suite bedrooms: a study bedroom with private bathroom containing a shower, toilet, and sink.
                Both types of bedroom contain a bed (with under-bed storage), shelving, a wardrobe and drawers, a desk with chair and lamp, and a notice board.</li>
          </ul>
        <p class="second-paragraph">
            Students in standard bedrooms are able to keep their rooms over the Christmas and Easter vacations. Those in en-suite accommodation will need to move out during these periods (although some belongings can be left in the under-bed storage). For this reason, we advise any students who may not be able to travel home in those vacations to opt for standard bedrooms.
        </p>
        <p class="third-paragraph">
            You do not need to tell us your preferred bedroom type on application. A few weeks before you arrive at Durham to take up your place to study, we will send you a room allocation questionnaire. We do everything we can to allocate you your preferred bedroom type, but we cannot guarantee this. We will let you know what type of room you have by mid-September. You will not know your exact room number before you arrive, but be assured that we will allocate a room for you.
        </p>
        <p class="fourth-paragraph">
            At Durham, we guarantee all first year students accommodation within their college. At Collingwood, you can also opt to live in College again in your returning years (second, third or fourth year), although most of our students prefer to rent private accommodation and share houses in the City for these years.
        </p>
        <p class="fifth-paragraph">
            Even if you live out in your returning years, you can still use the college facilities such as the JCR, bar, gym and music spaces!
        </p>
        <p class="sixth-paragraph">
            Collingwood College is a fully catered college. Livers in receive three meals per day, seven days a week! The cost of all meals is already included in your residence fee.
        </p>
        <p class="seventh-paragraph">
            The menus are varied and our catering team are able to cater for all dietary needs. You will find multiple vegetarian and vegan options at each meal. Meal times are long so our students are able to fit meals around any academic or extra-curricular activities. Flexi-catering means that you are able to get your lunch elsewhere on the University campus if you prefer, for example in one of the University outlets at The Bill Bryson Library or the Teaching and Learning Centre.
        </p>
        <p class="eigth-paragraph">
            All standard and en-suite corridors have small shared pantries containing a fridge, kettle, sink, toaster and microwave for snacks outside of meal times...but don't forget about our Toastie and Coffee Shop, The Wood'n'Spoon!
