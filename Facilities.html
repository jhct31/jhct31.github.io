        <h2>Facilities</h2>
        <p class="first-paragraph">
            We are a single-site college and almost all of the college is accessible within the same building, rather than split up into blocks.
        </p>
        <p class="second-paragraph">
            Collingwood has state-of-the-art facilities for all of the Collingwood community to enjoy (including when you might live out in your second, third/fourth years). Many of these facilities were provided thanks to donation of around £8 million by an alumnus of the college. It is important to understand why we invested so heavily in these spaces. The aim was not to build the flashiest facilities, although they certainly are amazing, but the aim is to provide facilities that support your extra-curricular personal development, and provide an environment that encourages Collingwood students to get involved, be ambitious and try new things.
        </p>
        <p class="third-paragraph">
            At Collingwood you will find:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A large JCR (social space) with pool tables, table tennis, table football, games consoles, film area, and more</li>
            <li>A theatre for all performing arts, equipped with industry-standard sound and lighting (including a motorized rig) and flexible seating for up to 200</li>
            <li>A film and media suite with state-of-the-art cameras and editing software</li>
            <li>Extended, air-conditioned gym with weights and cardio sections</li>
            <li>A studio space for fitness classes, dance, and indoor rowing</li>
            <li>A floodlit 3G rubber crumb multi-sports pitch</li>
            <li>2 cricket nets with a bowling machine</li>
            <li>Tennis and netball court</li>

            <li>A dedicated art room</li>
            <li>College library, with study space and a small stock of core textbooks</li>
            <li>Large college grounds, including the Meadow, with extensive landscaping</li>
