      <h2>College Life</h2>
      <p class="first-paragraph">
        Collingwood has one of the liveliest and largest groups of students in Durham University. Our students have always been very successful academically, in sports and in the arts. We have a very active student body (our JCR) who organise many activities and events. There are also lots of opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities. In addition, the JCR and the College can offer support and information throughout your time at University if you ever need it.
      </p>
      <p class="second-paragraph">
        555 students live in College. Students are strongly encouraged to live-in for their first year. Second, third and fourth year students tend to live out in rented accommodation in town, but it is possible for some students to stay in college for more than one year, and some choose to live back in college for their final year. Livers out are still part of the College community and will regularly come to College to use the facilities and to socialise.
      </p>
      <p class="third-paragraph">
        Our culture is informal and non-hierarchical. Collingwood is an energetic and modern College, and staff and students call each other by their first names. That's not to say we don't have traditions, of course... you'll often see energetic renditions of "Country Roads" at the end of a formal dinner!
      </p>
      <p class="fourth-paragraph">
        Livers in receive 3 meals per day, 7 days a week. The menus are varied and our catering team are able to cater for all dietary needs. Corridors have small shared pantries containing a fridge, kettle, sink, toaster and microwave for snacks outside of meal times...but don't forget about our Toastie and Coffee Shop, The Wood'n'Spoon!
      </p>
